                <h2>SE Engineering | Intern</h2>
                <p>My internship at SE Engineering, spanning from February to June, was a transformative experience where I delved into the realm of cutting-edge assistive technology. During this period, I spearheaded the development of innovative solutions aimed at enhancing the daily lives of visually impaired individuals. The projects involved the creation of smart glasses and a smart cane, harnessing the power of technology to provide a more inclusive and accessible environment for the visually impaired. This hands-on experience not only deepened my technical expertise but also instilled a profound sense of purpose in utilizing technology for social impact.</p>
